*from malama Mauna Lua's site*

We are kama‘aina and malihini. Working professionals and retirees. School kids. Full-time staff members and dedicated volunteers. Together we are Mālama Maunalua, a community-based, non-profit stewardship organization committed to conserving and restoring a healthy and productive Maunalua Bay.

We consider the Bay to be one of the cultural and environmental treasures of Hawaiʻi. Together with our volunteers and partners, we are implementing a long-term conservation plan that is based in science and draws extensively on local knowledge of long-term residents of the Maunalua region.

I had the honor of working beside this organization to not only study the invasive algae polluting our waters but also got to be at the beach for lab during my time in KCC.
