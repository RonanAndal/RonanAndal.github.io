## Project Overview

Website: <a href = "https://www.uhot.org/">UHOT</a>

More details about my job and what they do : <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/ctahr/tpss/"> Department of Tropical Plants and Soil Sciences </a>



During my free time on summer, I had a monitor I didn't have any use for, and I was scrolling through facebook marketplace one day and noticed a raspberry pi going for relatively cheap so I thought why not start this project.

The University of Hawai ªi Organic Transition (UHOT) website is designed to guide and support those interested in making a shift towards organic methods. The UHOT site serves as a hub of resources, offering insights into organic techniques, case studies, and research updates, while also providing tools to connect with the broader community.

Throughout my position, I discovered just how much I love the creative side of building a website. Each project, from enhancing visual layouts to optimizing user interactions, gave me the opportunity to think innovatively and explore design choices that could make a meaningful impact on the user experience.
