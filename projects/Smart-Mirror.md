## Project Overview

A significant aspect of my role centered around managing and enhancing the UHOT website, where I utilized my skills in Wix, JavaScript, and HTML to develop a more engaging, interactive platform. Beyond routine updates, I integrated dynamic content elements to keep the website relevant with the latest research, findings, and events in organic farming. By implementing custom HTML and JavaScript, I was able to fine-tune the design and interactivity, allowing for a more user-friendly navigation and a visually appealing layout that effectively conveys the project's mission. Leveraging Wix’s design tools, I optimized visual components, updated layouts, and streamlined navigation, aiming to make the website a valuable, accessible resource for seasoned organic farmers and newcomers to sustainable agriculture alike. Through these efforts, I transformed the UHOT website into a dynamic, informative hub that aligns with the evolving needs of its audience.

Throughout my position, I discovered just how much I love the creative side of building a website. Each project, from enhancing visual layouts to optimizing user interactions, gave me the opportunity to think innovatively and explore design choices that could make a meaningful impact on the user experience.
