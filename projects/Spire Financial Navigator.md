Spire Fisc Nav is a web application built as part of a semester-long collaboration project with Spire Hawai‘i, a financial advisory firm. The company previously used a complex Excel spreadsheet with multiple tabs and stress-test scenarios to forecast future financial sustainability. Our team was tasked with transforming this system into a user-friendly web-based platform.

The platform allows organizations to input historical financial data, run stress test simulations, and view the impact on their pro forma financial statements.

With Spire Fisc Nav, users can:
- Input financial data through clean, user-friendly forms
- Run scenario-based stress tests
- View generated future-year forecasts
- Export results to Excel or PDF (planned)

### Current Features:
- Modular form inputs based on Excel model structure
- Backend logic for scenario calculations
- API-driven data flow using Express and MongoDB
