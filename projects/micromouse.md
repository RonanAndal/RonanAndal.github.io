While graduating from McKinley High School with the Class of 2020 and achieving a GPA of 3.6 may appear as a minor feat to some, it stands as a significant milestone for me. This accomplishment not only represents the successful completion of my high school education but also reflects my commitment to academic excellence and personal growth during this pivotal phase of my journey.
