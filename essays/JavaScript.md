Coming from a mostly java background I think javascript is almost the same concept. Weird connection is I also edit videos & when I bought a macbook I had to make a switch from an app called Adobe premiere pro to final cut pro & that switch felt exactly the same as java to javascript. On the other hand I learned a lot from ES6. It was really refreshing to relearn some terms that were once not so clear to me. I think Javascript is a great programming language and from the praises from the professors of ICS 314 it sounds even better. I believe that athletic software engineering / WODS to be really helpful. One thing I have trouble with in coding is memorizing syntax & this was a great way to help that problem. It is stressful & it is a lot of pressure but without those two emotions there wouldn’t be joy when completing a WOD under the time limit but just like the quote “cole under pressure is diamonds.” I think with a little bit of perseverance & better time management these WODS would work with me.

Having primarily worked with Java, I find the transition to JavaScript surprisingly familiar, a weird connection to this shift but another hobby I have besides coding is video editing & the feeling I experienced when switching from Adobe Premiere Pro to Final Cut Pro was very similar. The parallels between these transitions struck me, mirroring the switch from Java to JavaScript. Engaging with the module proved to be an enlightening experience, offering a chance to revisit and solidify my understanding of terms that were once ambiguous.

My appreciation for JavaScript as a programming language has grown, especially considering the accolades it receives from professors in ICS 314. The incorporation of athletic software engineering and WODs (Workouts of the Day) has proven immensely beneficial. Addressing my struggle with memorizing syntax, this approach has provided a practical solution. While navigating through coding can be stressful and pressurizing, these emotions are integral to the sense of accomplishment when successfully completing a WOD within the specified time limit.

As the saying goes, "coal under pressure is diamonds." I am confident that with perseverance and improved time management, I can effectively conquer the challenges posed by these WODs. The stress and pressure become catalysts for the joy that accompanies the successful completion of each task.
