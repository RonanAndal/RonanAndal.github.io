### I. Introduction
AI in education to me is like that overfriendly TA in class who answers all your questions with no hesitation. The beauty of AI lies in its accessibility; it's like having that TA available whenever and wherever you have an internet connection. In software engineering, the role of AI can be perceived as both a blessing and a curse. It all depends on how you approach it. Some people will hit cmd+c and cmd+v a few times and call it a day, and some people will put the time and effort to understand.  Like the quote goes, 'Give a guy a fish and he eats for a day; teach a guy to fish and he eats for a lifetime.' In the realm of software engineering, those who invest in understanding the underlying principles not only solve the immediate problem but also equip themselves with valuable skills for the future. Personally, I've primarily utilized ChatGPT among various AI options, leveraging its capabilities to enhance my understanding and problem-solving in both general AI usage and specifically in ICS 314.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18\
Some experience WODs were pretty straightforward and had instructions to get the job done, but when instructions were lacking like when there was no instructional video google and ChatGPT was my saving grace


2. In-class Practice WODs\
I didn't want to use chatGPT for these WODS because the this was for the mere purpose of preparing you for the actual WOD which was actually graded unlike these in class ones where they weren't graded. I usually just discussed with my partner about how to approach this problem


3. In-class WODs \
I wrestled with a sense of guilt when turning to ChatGPT for assistance with my WODs. However, I found myself at a crossroads: either risk failing the WODs and then studying the answers afterward, or utilize AI to pass the WODs while still ensuring I understood the answers and their rationale. Either way I still was going to understand the answer so I chose the option that was gonna benefit me more in the future. As time went by however the guilt that built inside of me for using chatGPT for the previous WODS turned into countless hours studying the previous Experience WODs for the future WODs and by the end of the semester I really challenged myself not to use AI at all

4. Essays\
I've always struggled with making my thoughts sound more professional in a sense. I can go on for hours on end about the topics that professor has given us within the essays this semester just the execution which was lacking and chatGPT helped me out with it. I usually just typed my thoughts down on a google doc and even though it didn't sound horrible I thought it could sound and flow better so I would copy paste my initial thoughts into chatGPT and ask AI to make it sound a bit more professional. I wouldn't just go on chatGPT and copy paste the question given to us by the professor and ask it to make me an essay. 

5. Final project\
I was in rush for somethings due to some personal issues and needed to use chatGPT to finish it and not let my teammates down. Otherwise I treated the final project like it was an actual site I needed to make for an actual software engineering job

6. Learning a concept / tutorial\
Even though GPT isn't the only thing I turn to when learning a concept or tutorial it is for sure a factor that comes into play besides looking in textbooks and youtube videos and etc.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord\
I didn't really asked much questions in discord, because I usually just asked my group if I needed assistance. However with in class questions I just asked whatever come to my mind, don't need AI to help filter that

8. Asking or answering a smart-question\
Again didn't really ask much questions in the discord as well as answered any questions

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”\
I've never used chatGPT for that I probably used the site that professor gave us with all the options for Underscore

10. Explaining code\
Once I write something down in syntax without anything but my brain I have a pretty good understanding of it and would not need GPT to help me explain it, but maybe make it sound more professional or easier to understand to other people

11. Writing code\
For mostly all the assignments in this class it is usually a variation of a past homework or classwork we have done so the asnwers to it is all in our past homework, so when I'm not in a rush I like to check back in past assessments to figure out what to do but when time is an issue I like to result in GPT also In writing code I usually mess up on syntax and use chatGPT to help me with the little thing.

12. Documenting code



13. Quality assurance

Yes 

14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
The impact of AI on my learning journey has been profound. In the realm of ICS, where self-directed learning is the norm, AI has emerged as a valuable ally, significantly optimizing my study sessions and homework assignments. Its influence is unmistakable—it either streamlines tasks to simplicity or presents challenges of a higher order, leaving little room for middle ground. Nonetheless, its ability to accelerate learning and provide invaluable insights remains undeniable.

### IV. Practical Applications:
Some practical applications I use ChatGPT in is in emailing my professors about things and maybe making it sound more professional so I don't give them a hard time understanding my thoughts


### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
Some challenges I find with GPT is with my classmate's work I find it difficult to see if their work is actually their work or if they are letting AI do all the talking as they play a front on their screen. Opportunities however is all the time I saved whenever dealing with things 


### VI. Comparative Analysis:


### VII. Future Considerations:


### VIII. Conclusion:
