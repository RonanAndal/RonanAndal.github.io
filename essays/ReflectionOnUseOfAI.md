### I. Introduction
AI in education to me is like that overfriendly TA in class who answers all your questions with no hesitation. The beauty of AI lies in its accessibility; it's like having that TA available whenever and wherever you have an internet connection. In software engineering, the role of AI can be perceived as both a blessing and a curse. It all depends on how you approach it. Some people will hit cmd+c and cmd+v a few times and call it a day, and some people will put the time and effort to understand.  Like the quote goes, 'Give a guy a fish and he eats for a day; teach a guy to fish and he eats for a lifetime.' In the realm of software engineering, those who invest in understanding the underlying principles not only solve the immediate problem but also equip themselves with valuable skills for the future. Personally, I've primarily utilized ChatGPT among various AI options, leveraging its capabilities to enhance my understanding and problem-solving in both general AI usage and specifically in ICS 314.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18\
Some experience WODs were pretty straightforward and had instructions to get the job done, but when instructions were lacking like when there was no instructional video google and ChatGPT was my saving grace, but these just like the practice WODs were used to help us prepare for the actual in-class WODs so which is why GPT or not I still analyzed how I got the answer afterwards and did it over and over again just like how professor wanted


2. In-class Practice WODs\
I didn't want to use chatGPT for these WODS because the this was for the mere purpose of preparing you for the actual WOD which was actually graded unlike these in class ones where they weren't graded. I usually just discussed with my partner about how to approach this problem. Afterwards also Professor usually gave the answer as well.


3. In-class WODs \
I wrestled with a sense of guilt when turning to ChatGPT for assistance with my WODs. However, I found myself at a crossroads: either risk failing the WODs and then studying the answers afterward, or utilize AI to pass the WODs while still ensuring I understood the answers and their rationale. Either way I still was going to understand the answer so I chose the option that was gonna benefit me more in the future. As time went by however the guilt that built inside of me for using chatGPT for the previous WODS turned into countless hours studying the previous Experience WODs for the future WODs and by the end of the semester I really challenged myself not to use AI at all

4. Essays\
I've always struggled with making my thoughts sound more professional in a sense. I can go on for hours on end about the topics that professor has given us within the essays this semester just the execution which was lacking and chatGPT helped me out with it. I usually just typed my thoughts down on a google doc and even though it didn't sound horrible I thought it could sound and flow better so I would copy paste my initial thoughts into chatGPT and ask AI "Could you make this flow more better or sound more prfoessional". I wouldn't just go on chatGPT and copy paste the question given to us by the professor and ask it to make me an essay. 

5. Final project\
I was in rush for somethings due to some personal issues and needed to use chatGPT to finish it and not let my teammates down, just like when I had to make an exercise class for my project I asked GPT "Would I just take one of the existing collections and copy paste them and change up the variables and such?". Otherwise I treated the final project like it was an actual site I needed to make for an actual software engineering job

6. Learning a concept / tutorial\
Even though GPT isn't the only thing I turn to when learning a concept or tutorial it is for sure a factor that comes into play besides looking in textbooks and youtube videos and etc. I would ask GPT "GPT what do you know about ____" and then begin to do research out of GPT whether it be google, textbooks, youtube and etc.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord\
   I didn't ask many questions on Discord since I typically sought assistance from my group when needed. However, during in-class discussions, I freely raised any queries that came to mind, relying on my own judgment without the need for AI assistance to filter them.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question\
Again didn't really ask much questions in the discord as well as answered any questions

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”\
I've never used chatGPT for that I probably used the site that professor gave us with all the options for Underscore even though it would be beneficial to just ask GPT "could you give me an example of using Underscore .pluck"

10. Explaining code\
Once I write something down in syntax without anything but my brain I have a pretty good understanding of it and would not need GPT to help me explain it, but maybe make it sound more professional or easier to understand to other people I would probably ask GPT "Could you make this sound simpler" to make it sound better.

11. Writing code\
For mostly all the assignments in this class it is usually a variation of a past homework or classwork we have done so the answers to it is all in our past homework, so when I'm not in a rush I like to check back in past assessments to figure out what to do but when time is an issue I like to result in GPT also In writing code I usually mess up on syntax and use chatGPT to help me with the little thing.

12. Documenting code\
    Ensuring clear and concise documentation has rarely posed a challenge for me, particularly when I grasp the intricacies of what I'm coding. However, I occasionally seek GPT's aid to refine the grammar in my documentation. Additionally, in my quality assurance process, I employ GPT to verify the correctness of my code. This includes evaluating the clarity and completeness of my documentation, addressing any shortcomings or excessive verbosity as necessary.


13. Quality assurance\
In instances where I find myself prone to overlooking details in my projects, I've developed a habit of leveraging GPT's assistance. If a grading rubric or criteria is provided, I often copy and paste it alongside my project, prompting GPT with a specific question: 'How does my project align with the criteria?' This approach allows me to gain valuable insights and ensure that my work meets the expected standards.

14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above\

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
The impact of AI on my learning journey has been profound. In the realm of ICS, where self-directed learning is the norm, AI has emerged as a valuable ally, significantly optimizing my study sessions and homework assignments. Its influence is unmistakable—it either streamlines tasks to simplicity or presents challenges of a higher order, leaving little room for middle ground. Nonetheless, its ability to accelerate learning and provide invaluable insights remains undeniable.

### IV. Practical Applications:
In various practical applications, I've found ChatGPT to serve as a versatile personal assistant, almost like an extended Google search but with greater depth. For routine inquiries like converting yards to miles, I'd naturally turn to Google. However, when faced with questions requiring more nuanced responses or immediate assistance, such as understanding complex concepts or generating quick summaries, I opt for AI. This choice hinges on expediency, allowing me to access the most convenient solution based on time constraints.


### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
I encounter a few challenges with GPT, particularly when assessing my classmates' work. It can be challenging to discern whether they've genuinely contributed or simply relied on AI to do the heavy lifting, presenting it as their own. Another hurdle arises from the occasional feeling of dependence on GPT for assessments, which sometimes undermines confidence in my own thoughts. However, amidst these challenges, I recognize the significant time savings GPT affords me in various tasks. This surplus time allows me to redirect my focus towards endeavors that offer greater personal and academic benefits.


### VI. Comparative Analysis:
Let's consider two scenarios: one in which AI exists and one in which it doesn't. In scenario one, Student A, with access to AI, faces a WOD in Professor Moore's class. Without preparation, they resort to using chatGPT, ultimately receiving a perfect score. However, their reaction could vary depending on their ethics. They might view this success as a license to continue relying solely on AI, or they may feel unsatisfied with the artificial assistance and opt to dedicate themselves to studying for future assignments. In scenario two, Student B faces the same WOD without AI assistance and fails. Similarly, their response can diverge. They might resign themselves to failure, or they might recognize the need for greater effort and commit to studying diligently for subsequent tasks. These scenarios underscore the ethical and motivational implications of AI integration in education.


### VII. Future Considerations:
A professor once told me "You can learn almost anything on the internet if you're willing to put in the time and effort" With the assistance of AI, this rings truer than ever, as it significantly reduces the investment of both time and effort required for learning. As AI technology continues to evolve and improve, the path to acquiring knowledge will only become shorter and more accessible. This has also been one of the first classes where they have allowed and sometimes encouraged us to use chatGPT instead of completely banning it. Most classes I would take forbid it and use AI checkers to address the situation but I don't think these AI checkers are that much accurate knowing some people still get away with pulling this off. My future considerations would either be making stricter AI checkers or, completely banning chat GPT to some of the public or increasing the amount of work in school to make it somewhat challenging for students.



### VIII. Conclusion:
Ultimately having AI at your fingertips is either a blessing or a burden, it all depends on the person that's using it. One of my professors once told me you can learn almost anything on the internet if you put in the time and effort, and I think AI helps speed up that process ten fold. I feel like AI is only going to get better from here so you might as well use what you've been given. AI can continue to evolve all it wants but human nature will still stay the same
