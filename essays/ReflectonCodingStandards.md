As I was fiddling around with intelliJ I made a lot of errors at first, & it made me realize how sloppy my code must've looked if I didn't have this, but I also realized
I can't keep relying on this. Similar to this it made me realize how it was basically autocorrect & it made me also think about how horrendous
my texts would have been if I didn't have autocorrect on my Iphone
