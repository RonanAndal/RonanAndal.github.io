  "How you do one thing is how you do everything." Embracing this philosophy throughout my entire life, I have consistently believed in giving my best effort in whatever I did because it would then translate to whatever I had in store for me afterward.My realization came when I started using ESLint as a coding tool, akin to how IntelliJ serves as the iPhone keyboard. It acted as a corrective force, highlighting the sloppiness in my code and challenging me to make it better. Initially, my interaction with IntelliJ was akin to a learning curve â€“ numerous errors surfaced. However, with persistent use, I found myself fixing errors before they were pointed out, akin to developing a habit through continuous practice. It felt reminiscent of a parent persistently reminding you to make your bed, and then one day, you do it automatically, realizing it has become second nature.



  As I fiddled around more with ESLint, I realized that one day, I would navigate different coding environments and face more complex challenges. Just like making the bed in the morning was a mere starting point, maintaining code cleanliness was just the beginning of my coding journey. Reflecting on the wisdom imparted by one of my professors at UH Manoa, Nodari Sitchinava, "If you keep looking something up, you'll never remember it." At first, it may seem logical to look up information when needed, but his insight goes beyond mere information retrieval. It delves into the idea that actively committing information to memory, despite the initial effort, yields long-term benefits. Just as an investment grows over time, the time spent on remembering information pays off, saving you precious time in the future. It's a realization that echoes the importance of building a robust foundation for your thoughts and knowledge, allowing you to navigate challenges more efficiently and independently.
