<h2>Unexpected</h2> 

<p> Going into the semester—specifically ICS 414—I was genuinely excited to finally work on a real project alongside like-minded individuals. At the start of the year, I was looking forward to collaborating, building something meaningful, and pushing my skills further, and I can confidently say I wasn’t disappointed at all. I never imagined we’d end up creating an app like the Spire Financial Calculator, but the process taught me more than I expected. From sprint planning to debugging complex features, every step was both challenging and rewarding. Along the way, I got to meet incredibly talented and driven people who not only inspired me to level up my own work but also encouraged me to keep growing outside the classroom. Thanks to this course and the experience it gave me, I was able to land my first programming-related internship—which honestly felt like a major turning point for me.

I learned a lot from this experience, I purposely asked the team to put me in the backend team because my backend development needed work. Even though i was severely carried by the other backend team, it was still a great experience

<h3>Expectations vs Reality </h3>
<p>I’ll be honest—I really thought this class was going to be a breeze. At the beginning of the semester, one of my teammates and I were joking around, saying we’d probably be done with everything by spring break. It felt like we had plenty of time and that the project wouldn’t be too intense. But as spring break rolled around, reality hit us—there were still so many unfinished tasks, new issues popping up, and unexpected changes to handle. That moment was a wake-up call. It showed me just how unpredictable the software development process can be, and how even the best-laid plans can quickly shift. More importantly, it taught me that this kind of uncertainty is normal in the industry. Things don’t always go smoothly, and that’s okay. What matters most is learning to adapt, communicate, and keep moving forward as a team.</p>




<h2>Wrapping it All Up</h2>
<p>
But by May, we pulled through. We came out with an app that not only looked great but functioned exactly how we envisioned. On top of that, I walked away with more people I can proudly call friends within the department, a solid project I can showcase on my resume, and another meaningful experience I can confidently talk about in future interviews. ICS 414 wasn’t just a class—it was a real stepping stone, both technically and personally, and I’m genuinely proud of how far we came.</p>
