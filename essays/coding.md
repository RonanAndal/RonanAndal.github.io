<p>I feel like a majority of the people I talk to have an interest in software engineering due to a video game they played when they were younger. I am guilty of falling into that category. Although I forgot which video game sparked my interest as I played games / used apps growing up, I started growing curious how everything works, how if I pushed a significant button, a certain scenario would happen, & if I pressed a whole bunch of other buttons with the initial button, a whole new scenario would happen. I started getting inspired where the developers got the ideas for these creations, let alone put those ideas onto a set of code for a handful of people to enjoy.</p>

<p>Coding to me brings immense joy when executed successfully, yet the challenge arises when stumbling upon issues, to a moment where it feels like the world is ablaze. Paradoxically, it's within these challenges that the essence of joy emerges, for without hurdles, the true satisfaction of overcoming obstacles and achieving mastery would not be as rewarding. This coding high is the feeling I chase at times when doing assignments & it’s what keeps me going when the classes get tougher & tougher. As the saying goes, "Nothing worth having comes easy," computer science, renowned as one of the most challenging majors, undoubtedly holds substantial value. </p>
 
<p>While my hands-on experience may be limited I am ecstatic to see where the future takes me as I keep expanding my knowledge & meet new faces in software engineeringIn the nascent stages of my coding journey, the excitement and anticipation for the future are palpable. 
The journey ahead holds the promise of continuous growth and discovery. Each line of code written and every problem encountered is an opportunity for learning and improvement. The allure of exploring new facets of software engineering is like embarking on an uncharted adventure, with each challenge serving as a stepping stone toward mastery. As the wise words of Mark Zuckerberg, one of the greatest software engineers said “The biggest risk is not taking any risk.”</p>
