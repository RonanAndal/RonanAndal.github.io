## Like an Iphone Keyboard
  <blockquote>
"How you do one thing is how you do everything." Embracing this philosophy throughout my entire life, I have consistently believed in giving my best effort in whatever I did because it would then translate to whatever I had in store for me afterward. My realization came when I started using ESLint as a coding tool, akin to how IntelliJ serves as the iPhone keyboard. It acted as a corrective force, highlighting the sloppiness in my code and challenging me to make it better. Initially, my interaction with IntelliJ was akin to a learning curve â€“ numerous errors surfaced. However, with persistent use, I found myself fixing errors before they were pointed out, akin to developing a habit through continuous practice. It felt reminiscent of a parent persistently reminding you to make your bed, and then one day, you do it automatically, realizing it has become second nature.

## Consistency Goes a Long Way
 <p>As I delved further into ESLint, I came to realize that one day, I would navigate different coding environments and encounter more complex challenges. Just as making the bed in the morning serves as a mere starting point, maintaining code cleanliness was only the beginning of my coding journey. Reflecting on the wisdom imparted by one of my professors at UH Manoa, Nodari Sitchinava, "If you keep looking something up, you'll never remember it." At first glance, it may seem logical to search for information when needed, but his insight extends beyond mere information retrieval. It delves into the concept that actively committing information to memory, despite the initial effort, yields long-term benefits. Just as an investment grows over time, the time spent on memorization pays off, saving you precious time in the future. This realization underscores the importance of building a robust foundation for your thoughts and knowledge, enabling you to navigate challenges more efficiently and independently.</p>

## The Positives
  <p>In conclusion, my experience with ESLint has been both beneficial and challenging, and surprisingly, each aspect has contributed positively to my coding journey. The challenge lies in the discomfort it brought, prompting self-reflection on the growing sloppiness in my code writing and its tangible impact on my daily routines. However, this discomfort has proven to be useful as it spurred newfound awareness, encouraging me to address and enhance my coding practices. In less than a week of integrating ESLint into my workflow, I'm already anticipating the broader benefits it might bring throughout the semester. It's reminiscent of the wise saying, "A problem well defined is a problem half solved," so I guess my coding problem is halfway solved. </p>
