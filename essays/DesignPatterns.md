<p>"Design is thinking made visual" said Oscar winning filmmaker Saul Bass. Almost everywhere you look in this world there is some sort of design pattern whether it is a bad design pattern or a good one, which also means these are all visuals that were made from someone's thinking. In the vast tapestry of our digital realm, design patterns are the threads that weave together functionality and elegance, efficiency and maintainability. </p>

<p>Consider that traffic light down your street, it's simple yet effective design, with its three colors conveying even simpler instructions to cars and pedestrians alike, is a testament to the power of thoughtful design. In this way design patterns are not merely constructs of code; they are the living proof of human ingenuity, encapsulating our collecting understanding of problem-solving for the present and for years to come. Yet, just as in the physical world, not all designs are equal. Just as like that poorly constructed parking lot at Hawaiian Brian's with little to no room for car's doors to be opened when there is an event, so too can poorly implemented design patterns lead to code that is fragile, convoluted, or difficult to maintain. Thus, discerning between good and bad design patterns becomes paramount in the pursuit of robust, scalable software solutions</p>

<p>While my hands-on experience may be limited I am ecstatic to see where the future takes me as I keep expanding my knowledge & meet new faces in software engineering. In the nascent stages of my coding journey, the excitement and anticipation for the future are palpable. 
The journey ahead holds the promise of continuous growth and discovery. Each line of code written and every problem encountered is an opportunity for learning and improvement. The allure of exploring new facets of software engineering is like embarking on an uncharted adventure, with each challenge serving as a stepping stone toward mastery. As the wise words of Mark Zuckerberg, one of the greatest software engineers said “The biggest risk is not taking any risk.”</p>
