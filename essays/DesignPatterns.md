<p>"Design is thinking made visual" said Oscar winning filmmaker Saul Bass. Almost everywhere you look in this world there is some sort of design pattern whether it's a bad design pattern or a good one, which also means these were all visuals that were made from someone's thinking. In the vast landscape of software engineering, design patterns stand as the symphonic orchestrators, conducting the intricate dance between creativity and pragmatism. Just as a composer draws inspiration from the harmonies of the past to create a new masterpiece, so too do developers leverage the timeless melodies of design patterns to craft elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.

<p>Consider that traffic light down your street, it's simple yet effective design, with its three colors conveying even simpler instructions to cars and pedestrians alike, is a testament to the power of thoughtful design. In this way design patterns are not merely constructs of code; they are the living proof of human ingenuity, encapsulating our collecting understanding of problem-solving for the present and for years to come. Yet, just as in the physical world, not all designs are equal. Just as like that poorly constructed parking lot at Hawaiian Brian's with little to no room for car's doors to be opened when there is an event, so too can poorly implemented design patterns lead to code that is fragile, convoluted, or difficult to maintain. Thus, discerning between good and bad design patterns becomes paramount in the pursuit of robust, scalable software solutions</p>
