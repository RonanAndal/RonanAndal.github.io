<p>In the words of Oscar-winning filmmaker Saul Bass, 'Design is thinking made visual.' Throughout our world, design patterns abound, each a manifestation of someone's creativity and thought process. Whether exemplary or lacking, they all represent the fusion of ideas into visuals. In our expansive digital landscape, design patterns serve as the threads knitting together functionality with elegance, efficiency with maintainability.

<p>Consider that traffic light down your street, </p>

<p>it's simple yet effective design, with its three colors conveying even simpler instructions to cars and pedestrians alike, is a testament to the power of thoughtful design. In this way design patterns are not merely constructs of code; they are the living proof of human ingenuity, encapsulating our collecting understanding of problem-solving for the present and for years to come. Yet, just as in the physical world, not all designs are equal. Just as like that poorly constructed parking lot at Hawaiian Brian's with little to no room for car's doors to be opened when there is an event, so too can poorly implemented design patterns lead to code that is fragile, convoluted, or difficult to maintain. Thus, discerning between good and bad design patterns becomes paramount in the pursuit of robust, scalable software solutions</p>

<p>
Some design patterns I have recently employed in my coding endeavors serve as testaments to the power of thoughtful design and the pursuit of excellence in software development. Among these patterns, one stands out as a beacon of efficiency and innovation: the Template Method Pattern.</p>

<p>Much like a seasoned architect who draws upon blueprints of past structures to inform the design of new edifices, I have leveraged the Template Method Pattern to streamline the development process and promote code reusability. In my final project for ICS 314, tasked with implementing a series of data processing pipelines for diverse applications, I crafted a generic framework that outlines the common steps and procedures required for data processing. This framework, akin to a master blueprint, served as the foundation upon which specific pipelines were built, with each new application requiring only minor modifications to adapt to its unique requirements.</p>


<p>"I have also utilized the Prototype pattern, a design pattern that involves creating new objects by copying existing ones and then modifying them as needed. In a recent project for my ICS 314 final assignment, I encountered the challenge of creating new collections for users and profiles within the application. Drawing inspiration from my professor's template, which already contained similar structures, I realized that the Prototype pattern offered an elegant solution to expedite the development process.</p>

<p>By leveraging the Prototype pattern, I was able to clone existing collections from the template, serving as prototypes for the new collections I needed to create. This approach allowed me to inherit the core structure and functionality of the original collections while providing the flexibility to customize and modify them to suit the specific requirements of my project. In essence, the Prototype pattern served as a catalyst for innovation, empowering me to build upon proven solutions and adapt them to address novel challenges.</p>

<p>Through the strategic application of the Prototype pattern, I not only expedited the development process but also ensured consistency and reliability across the application. By standing on the shoulders of giants, so to speak, and building upon existing foundations, I was able to achieve a higher level of efficiency and maintainability in my codebase."</p>

<p>In conclusion, the journey of software development is a testament to the power of design patterns, those timeless blueprints that illuminate the path to excellence. From the simplicity of a traffic light to the intricacies of digital architecture, design patterns serve as the guiding stars that navigate us through the vast expanse of possibility. And in the words of Oscar-winning filmmaker Saul Bass, 'Design is thinking made visual,' echoing the sentiment that design patterns, in all their forms, are the tangible manifestations of human creativity and ingenuity in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
